INGREDIENTS

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
|  | Yield:1 shallow springform cake |


  

1 lb semisweet chocolate (or 50/50 mix of semisweet and bittersweet)

10 T butter (salted or unsalted), softened  
1 T all-purpose flour  
1 T sugar  
4 eggs, separated  
Sweetened whipped cream  
  
  
PREPARATION

  

1.  Heat oven to 425 degrees. Line the base of an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper.

  

2.  Melt the chocolate in the microwave.  
  

3.  Stir the butter, flour, and sugar into the melted chocolate. Beat the yolks lightly and whisk into the chocolate mixture gradually.  
  

4.  Beat the egg whites until they hold a definite shape but are not dry and fold into the chocolate mixture. The beaten egg whites should be folded smoothly, quickly and easily into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat; open the oven door, leaving it ajar, and allow the cake to cool completely in the oven.  
  

5.  Serve warm with whipped cream.
