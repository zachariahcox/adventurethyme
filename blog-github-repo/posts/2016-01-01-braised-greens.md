3 tablespoons olive oil  
1 medium onion, minced (about 1 cup)  
5 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 5 teaspoons)  
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1 bunch greens, ribs removed, leaves chopped into 2-inch squares  
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth  
Table salt  
2t lemon juice  
  
Note: for thicker greens like collards or kale, increase cooking time by up to 10 minutes, add 1 cup water  
  
Heat 1 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven or non-stick skillet over medium heat until shimmering.  
Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and beginning to brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  
Add garlic and pepper flakes; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.  
Add half of greens and stir until beginning to wilt, about 1 minute.  
Add remaining greens, broth, water, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; quickly cover pot and reduce heat to medium-low.  
Cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are tender:  
    25 to 35 minutes for kale  
    35 to 45 minutes for collards.  
    10 to 20 minutes for cabbage collards, or dino kale, or other thin greens  
  
  
Remove lid and increase heat to medium-high.  
Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid has evaporated (bottom of pot will be almost dry and greens will begin to sizzle), 8 to 12 minutes.  
Remove pot from heat; stir in half lemon juice and remaining olive oil.  
Season with salt, pepper, and remaining teaspoon lemon juice.
