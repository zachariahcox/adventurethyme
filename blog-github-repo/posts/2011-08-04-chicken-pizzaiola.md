#### SERVES 4

INGREDIENTS



*   3cups tomato sauce (must be very flavorful)
*   1cup [grated Parmesan cheese](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=10186)
*   4[boneless, skinless chicken breasts](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9880)
*   [Salt and ground black pepper](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9842)
*   1cup [shredded mozzarella cheese](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9803) (or sliced)
*   40-60slices pepperoni (or prosciutto possibly)
*        fresh basil (this is really key to freshening up this quick, childlike dish)

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  1. **HEAT OVEN AND PREPARE BAKING DISH:** Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Spread tomato sauce into 13 by 9-inch baking dish.
    
2.  2. **COAT CHICKEN WITH PARMESAN:** Spread Parmesan into shallow dish. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with one breast at a time, dredge in Parmesan. Press on Parmesan to make sure it adheres. Lay chicken in baking dish, smooth side facing up.
    
3.  3. **BAKE CHICKEN:** Place chicken in oven and bake 15 minutes. We found this to be somewhat inadequate, and ended up overcooking the pepperoni. If using large chicken breasts, cook longer, perhaps 20 min.
    
4.  4. **INCREASE OVEN TEMPERATURE, ADD TOPPINGS, AND FINISH:** Increase oven temperature to 475 degrees. Mound 1/4 cup of mozzarella on top of each chicken breast, then shingle 10-15 slices pepperoni over cheese. Continue to bake until cheese melts and until thickest part of breast registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve.
