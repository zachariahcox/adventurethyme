We have started a grand undertaking here at Adventure Thyme. We have decided to cook a dish from every country in the UN! In Alphabetical order! Starting with The!  
  
So needless to say, we began with "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." Its totally obvious, am I right?  
  
After looking around we decided to make Macedonia Souvlaki and Tzatziki.  
  
For the Tzatziki:  
32-ounces of Greek style yogurt  
1 large cucumber  
1/4 cup finely chopped onion  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
1/4 cup fresh chopped dill  
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil  
1 tablespoons cider or white vinegar  
  
Salt and pepper to taste  
  
  
Peel and grate the cucumbers.  
  
Add the cucumber and all other ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
|  | to the strained yogurt and mix well. |
|  | For the Souvlaki: |
| 2 pound | s beef sirloin, (we used chuck instead) cut in 1 to 1 1/2 inch chunks |
| 1/4 cup | vegetable oil |
| 1/8 cup | dry red wine(optional) |
| 1 1/2 t | easpoons granulated garlic |
| 1 1/2 t | easpoons onion powder |
| 2 t | easpoons dried oregano |
| 2 t | easpoons chopped fresh rosemary (optional) |
| 1/2 t | easpoons fresh ground black pepper |
| 2 t | easpoons salt |
|  | Combine ingredients and mix to coat meat evenly. Thread onto skewers, and leave alone in the fridge for an hour or so. |
|  | We then seared the meat very briefly in a pan with a little olive oil and grilled the meat in a george forman grill for around 5 minutes. |
