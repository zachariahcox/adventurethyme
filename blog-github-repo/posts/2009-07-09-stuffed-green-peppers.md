Zach and Llael went to their pantry and said,  
"Hey! We have lots of extra Green Peppers... and meat! We should use these somehow, lets send Matt and Brian to the store to pick up ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
|  | for a dish we haven't looked up yet." |
|  | And so, with such humble beginnings, our dinner was planned. |
|  | After I returned from the store with assorted ingredients that I felt might be helpful for a stuffed bell pepper dish, (they most certainly were not helpful at all, but hey... at least we got to snack on blueberries!) we got to looking up a good recipe to use. Nothing that we could find was close to what we wanted, so we ended up modifying a Bell Pepper stuffed with spiced lamb recipe. |


Our Ingredients

Green Pepper

4

Brown Rice

1/2 cup

Onion (chopped)

1

Ground pork

1 lbs (ish)

Pepper Jack Cheese (grated)

1 block

Garlic Ginger Paste

1 Tbl

Red Pepper flakes

1/2 Tea

Cumin

1 Tbl

Cardamom

1 Tea

Sun Dried Tomatoes (Diced)

1 can (12 oz)

Fresh Cilantro (chopped)

3 Tbl

Brian cut the tops of the peppers and de-seeded them and then boiled them for 3 minutes until soft. While he was doing that we threw the rice into a rice cooker and started the Meat. We cooked the onions in oil until brown and then tossed the meat and spices. Once the meat was cooked we put in the ginger paste.  
  
Once everything was cooked we combined the meat, rice, cilantro and most of the cheese, and tomatoes and then stuffed the peppers full (And boy did we stuff them, we probably had twice as much filling as we needed, but we were making STUFFED peppers, and you certainly could not say ours were not stuffed.)  
  
We then baked them for 30 minutes at 350 in a casserole dish so if they fell over the filling wouldn't spread out.  
  
And then all that was left was the eating! We felt it wasn't spicy enough so we had some red chili sauce on the side. (And a picture or two)  
  
Pictures above yay!
