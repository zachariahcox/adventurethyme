####   

#### For the Pork:

#### INGREDIENTS



2

pork tenderloins , (12 to 16 oz each), trimmed of fat and silver skin

1 1/4

teaspoons [salt](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9842)

3/4

teaspoon [ground black pepper](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=15243)

2

teaspoons vegetable oil

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  1\. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 400 degrees. Sprinkle tenderloins evenly with salt and pepper; rub seasoning into meat. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Place both tenderloins in skillet; cook until well browned, 3 minutes. Using tongs, rotate tenderloins 1/4 turn; cook until well browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat until all sides are browned. Transfer tenderloins to rimmed baking sheet and place in oven (reserve skillet if making pan sauce); roast until internal temperature registers 135 to 140 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 10 to 16 minutes. (Begin pan sauce, if making, while meat roasts.)
    
2.  2\. Transfer tenderloins to cutting board and tent loosely with foil (continue with pan sauce, if making); let rest until internal temperature registers 145 to 150 degrees, 8 to 10 minutes. Cut tenderloins crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices, arrange on platter or individual plates, and spoon sauce (if using) over; serve immediately. We cut on a bias.
    
      
    
    FOR THE SAUCE:
    
    #### INGREDIENTS
    
    11
    
    cloves garlic (about 2 tablespoons)
    
    2
    
    tablespoons water
    
    1
    
    tablespoon vegetable oil
    
    1/4
    
    teaspoon red pepper flakes
    
    2
    
    teaspoons [light brown sugar](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9883)
    
    3
    
    tablespoons lime juice from 2 limes
    
    1/4
    
    cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
    
    1
    
    tablespoon chopped fresh chives
    
    4
    
    tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 4 pieces
    
    [Table salt and ground black pepper](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9842)
    
    #### INSTRUCTIONS
    
    1.  1\. Mix garlic paste with water in small bowl. Add oil to still-hot skillet and swirl to coat; add garlic paste and cook with skillet's residual heat, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon, until sizzling subsides, about 2 minutes. Set skillet over low heat and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until garlic is sticky, 8 to 10 minutes; set skillet aside off heat.
        
    2.  2\. While pork is resting, set skillet over medium heat; add pepper flakes and sugar to skillet and cook until sticky and sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Add lime juice, cilantro, and chives; simmer to blend flavors, 1 to 2 minutes. Add any accumulated pork juices and simmer 1 minute longer. Off heat, whisk in butter, one piece at a time.

        tablespoons unsalted butter
        
        1 1/4
        
        pounds cremini mushrooms , wiped clean with a paper towel, stems discarded, and caps cut into fourths if small or sixths if medium or large
        
        2

        [Salt](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=9842)
        
        3
        
        medium cloves garlic , pressed through garlic press or minced (about 1 tablespoon)
        
        1
        
        pound [Arborio rice](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=13283) (2 1/8 cups)
        
        1
        
        cup dry white wine (sherry)
        
        2
        
        ounces [Parmesan cheese](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=10186) , finely grated (about 1 cup)
        
        2
        
        tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
        
        [Ground black pepper](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/tastetests/overview.asp?docid=15243)
        
        #### INSTRUCTIONS
        
        1.  1\. Tie together bay leaves, thyme sprigs, and parsley sprigs with kitchen twine. Bring bundled herbs, porcini mushrooms, chicken broth, soy sauce, and 3 1/2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat; reduce to medium-low and simmer until dried mushrooms are softened and fully hydrated, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard herb bundle and strain broth through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl (you should have about 6 1/2 cups strained liquid); return liquid to saucepan and keep warm over low heat. Finely mince porcini and set aside.
            
        2.  2\. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When foaming subsides, add cremini mushrooms, 1 cup onions, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture released by mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are well browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute, then transfer mushrooms to oven-safe bowl and keep warm in oven. Off heat, add 1/4 cup water to now-empty skillet and scrape with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits; pour liquid from skillet into saucepan with broth.  
            
        3.  3\. Heat 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add remaining 1 cup onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and translucent, about 9 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until grainsâ€™ edges are transparent, about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently, until rice absorbs wine. Add minced porcini and 3 1/2 cups broth and cook, stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is absorbed, 9 to 11 minutes. Stir in additional 1/2 cup broth every 2 to 3 minutes until rice is cooked through but grains are still somewhat firm at center, 10 to 12 minutes (rice may not require all of broth). Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter, then stir in mushrooms (and any accumulated juices), Parmesan, and chopped parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; serve immediately in warmed bowls.
            
              
            
            Notes: Don't worry, the rice will absorb all that liquid! Next time, try not to overcook it. The upper times here are probably max times. Good flavors.
            
              
            
            We served this with steamed snap peas and for desssert: spiced stewed apples over vanilla ice cream.
