Ingredients:

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
|  | Boneless **room-temperature** strip steaks, 1.5 to 1.75 inches thick, cut in half to create 8oz steaks |
|  | Kosher salt |
|  | Ground black pepper |
| 1 t | ablespoon vegetable oil |
|  | Notes about meat: |
|  | Rib-eye or filet mignon of similar thickness can be substituted for strip steaks with the following modifications |
|  | If using filet mignon: |


*   buying a center-cut tenderloin roast and portioning it into 8oz steaks yourself will produce more consistent results. 
*   increase the oven time by about 5 minutes.
*   add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan to account for leanness. 

    If using very lean steaks (without an external fat cap):  

*   add an extra tablespoon of oil to the pan. 

  

INSTRUCTIONS: 

  
Leave steaks out on counter until they are **room temperature**.  
  

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to **275 degrees**. 

  

Pat steaks **dry** with paper towel.  

  
Season entire surface of steaks liberally with **Kosher salt and pepper**. 

  

Gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1.5 inches thick.

  
Place steaks on **wire rack** set in rimmed baking sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven.

  
Cook until instant-read **thermometer** inserted in center of steak registers  

*   **90 to 95 degrees** for rare to medium-rare: **18 to 23 minutes**
*   **100 to 105** degrees for medium: **25 to 30 minutes**

  

_NOTE: Our intent is for both flat sides to be well-browned and crusty and for the fond not to be burnt. The flat sides of the steaks shall cook for no more than **4.5 minutes** total, TOPS. The last time I used this recipe, the each side was well browned in around **45 seconds**. Perhaps my pan was too hot?_

  

Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking: place steaks in pan. 

  
For each side, **lift meat once halfway through** to redistribute fat underneath.  
  
**Reduce heat if fond begins to burn**. I also tilt the pan around during cooking if the oil is starting to stick.  
Transfer all steaks to wire cooling rack and **reduce heat under pan to medium**.  
  
Use tongs to stand 2 steaks at a time on their sides, producing a "**steak cube**."  
  
Holding steaks together in cube form, return to skillet and sear on remaining sides until browned, about **1.5 minutes** total.  
  
Transfer steaks back to wire cooling rack set **over a plate or cutting board** and let rest **10 minutes**, loosely tented with foil.  
  
Serve with **low-sodium** pan sauce.
