####   

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  1\. Heat the butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds.
    
2.  2\. Add the tomato paste and stir in 1/2 cup of the stock to dissolve the tomato paste. Add the remaining stock, cabbage, beets, 4 tablespoons vinegar, sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until the vegetables are soft and tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Add the kielbasa about 20 minutes before the vegetables become tender. (The soup can be cooled and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.)
    
3.  3\. Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water, and add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring once or twice to ensure even cooking. Cook until a thin-bladed paring knife or metal cake tester inserted into a potato can be removed with no resistance, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes, cool slightly, and cut into quarters.
    
4.  4\. Stir the meat into the pot and remove the bay leaf. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding the remaining 1 to 2 tablespoons of vinegar, pepper to taste, and 1/4 cup dill. Place 4 potato quarters in each individual soup bowl and ladle some soup over the potatoes. Remove the sausage from the pot and cut into slices 1/4 inch thick. Arrange the slices in each individual bowl with the potatoes. Top with 2 more pieces of potato, a generous dollop of sour cream, and a generous sprinkling of dill.
    
      
    
    Modifications:
    
    We used chicken sausage instead of kielbasa
    
    Thoughts:
    
    \- Too much vinegar, sugar, and salt
    
    \- chicken sausage doesn't work here
    
    \- overall, tasty and healthy
    
    Next Time:
    
    \- Add no sugar
    
    \- Halve the vinegar (or don't add more at the end)
    
    \- increase proportion of onions and carrots relative to beets (to further lessen the sweet taste)
    
    \- use stewed beef as meat
    
    \- serve with dark thick bread
