For the meatballs we used this:

  

Meatballs

2 slices white sandwich bread (crusts discarded), torn into small cubes

1/2 cup buttermilk or 6 tablespoons plain yogurt thinned with 2 tablespoons sweet milk

1 pound ground beef chuck

1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves

1 large egg yolk

1 small clove garlic , minced (1 teaspoon)

3/4 teaspoon table salt

Ground black pepper

vegetable oil for pan-frying (about 1 1/4 cups)

  

And for the tomato sauce:

  

2 T unsalted butter

1/4 c grated onion (or in food processor)

1/4 t dried oregano

salt to taste

2 garlic cloves

1 can crushed tomatoes (28 oz)

1/4 t sugar

2 T fresh basil

1 T olive oil

ground black pepper

  

Heat butter over mediumheat until melted. Add onion, oregano, and 1/2 t salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and onion is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and sugar; increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in basil and oil; season with salt and pepper.
