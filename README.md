# Adventure Thyme Recipe Blog

A collection of recipes transformed from a Blogspot blog into a clean, well-organized GitHub Pages site using GitHub Copilot.

## üç≥ About This Project

This repository contains a recipe blog that was originally hosted on Blogspot and has been converted to a static site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The entire transformation process was guided and enhanced by GitHub Copilot, making it a showcase of how AI assistance can streamline web development.

## ü§ñ How GitHub Copilot Helped Create This Site

This project demonstrates the power of AI pair programming through GitHub Copilot. Here's how Copilot contributed:

1. **Recipe Formatting**: Copilot helped format over 50 recipe files from plain text into structured Markdown with consistent formatting, including:
   - Clean ingredient tables with quantities and names
   - Numbered instruction steps
   - Properly formatted section headers
   - Consistent metadata and frontmatter

2. **Content Organization**: Copilot suggested an optimal organization structure for the recipes, creating category sections and a logical navigation flow.

3. **Feature Implementation**: Copilot assisted in adding site features like:
   - A simple search functionality using Simple Jekyll Search
   - A well-structured homepage with categorized recipe sections
   - Proper Jekyll configuration

4. **Script Creation**: Copilot helped write utility scripts to:
   - Process and clean up recipe files
   - Remove unnecessary code and comments
   - Consolidate duplicate files

5. **Problem Solving**: When challenges arose, Copilot suggested multiple approaches and helped debug issues to ensure everything worked correctly.
