## Instructions

1. For the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley, eggs, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix gently with your hands until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
2. Form the mixture into 1.5-inch meatballs (about 24 meatballs).
3. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, brown the meatballs on all sides, about 5-7 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.
4. For the sauce: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
5. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
6. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), bay leaves, and sugar. Stir to combine.
7. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then add the browned meatballs.
8. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours for deeper flavor), stirring occasionally.
9. About 15 minutes before serving, cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted water according to package directions until al dente.
10. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.
11. Remove bay leaves from the sauce. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
12. Serve spaghetti topped with meatballs and sauce, garnished with torn basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese.

_Note: For extra flavor, add a Parmesan rind to the sauce while it simmers._
