#### SERVES 4 TO 6

INGREDIENTS



*   2tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil
*   1medium leek (white and light green parts only), chopped
*   2tablespoons dry sherry
*   2   crushed garlic cloves
*   2pounds broccoli, stalks discarded and florets cut into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)
*   2cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth)
*        ground white pepper
*   3/4cup whole milk

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  1\. Heat butter or oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add leek; sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic.  Add sherry and broccoli; stir until sherry evaporates, about 30 seconds.
    
2.  2\. Add broth and pepper to taste to saucepan; bring to boil. Reduce heat to simmer; cover and cook until broccoli is tender, about 10 minutes.
    
3.  3\. Add 1/2 cup milk; blend until very smooth with immersion blender. Cook over low heat until warmed through. If soup is too thick, stir in additional milk to thin consistency. Adjust seasonings. (Soup can be refrigerated for 3 days and reheated just before serving.)
