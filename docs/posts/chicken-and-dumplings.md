## Instructions

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Brown chicken on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate.
2. Reduce heat to medium and add butter to the pot. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
5. Gradually whisk in chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
6. Add bay leaves and thyme. Return chicken to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes.
7. Remove chicken and let cool slightly. Discard skin and bones, and shred meat. Return the shredded chicken to the pot.
8. Stir in heavy cream, parsley, and peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
9. For the dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and herbs.
10. Add melted butter and milk, stirring just until a thick batter forms.
11. Drop spoonfuls of the dumpling batter onto the surface of the simmering stew.
12. Cover and cook for 15 minutes without lifting the lid. The dumplings should be puffed and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.
13. Serve hot, garnished with additional fresh herbs if desired.
