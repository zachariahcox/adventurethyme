_Perfect steaks with a restaurant-quality sear_
_Serves 2-4_

## Ingredients


| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2-4 | strip steaks (New York strip), 1 to 1.5 inches thick |
| | Kosher salt |
| | Freshly ground black pepper |
| 2 Tbsp | vegetable oil or other high smoke-point oil |
| 2 Tbsp | butter |
| 4 cloves | garlic, smashed |
| 4 sprigs | fresh thyme |

## Instructions


1. Pat steaks completely dry with paper towels. This is crucial for achieving a good crust.
2. Season generously with kosher salt and black pepper on both sides.
3. Place steaks uncovered on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days. This dry-aging process helps develop flavor and texture.
4. Remove steaks from refrigerator 1-2 hours before cooking to bring them to room temperature.
5. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 5 minutes.
6. Add oil to the skillet. When it begins to shimmer and smoke slightly, carefully place the steaks in the skillet.
7. Sear steaks without moving them for 3-4 minutes to develop a crust.
8. Flip steaks and add butter, garlic, and thyme to the skillet.
9. Continue cooking for 3-4 minutes more, occasionally tilting the pan and spooning the butter mixture over the steaks.
10. For medium-rare (130-135°F), cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 125°F (temperature will rise during resting).
11. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 5-10 minutes.
12. Slice against the grain and serve, drizzled with any remaining pan juices.

_Note: The extended drying time in the refrigerator is essential to achieve the perfect sear. Don't skip this step!_
