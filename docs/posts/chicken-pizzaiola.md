_Serves 4_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4 | boneless, skinless chicken breasts |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1/4 tsp | black pepper |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 | medium onion, thinly sliced |
| 4 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 (28 oz) can | crushed tomatoes |
| 1 tsp | dried oregano |
| 1/2 tsp | red pepper flakes |
| 1/4 cup | fresh basil, chopped |
| 8 oz | mozzarella cheese, sliced |
| 1/4 cup | grated Parmesan cheese |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
4. In the same skillet, add onions and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
5. Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes until slightly thickened.
6. Stir in half of the basil. Return chicken to the skillet, nestling it into the sauce.
7. Top each chicken breast with mozzarella slices and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
8. Transfer skillet to the oven and bake until chicken is cooked through and cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15-20 minutes.
9. Sprinkle with remaining fresh basil before serving.
