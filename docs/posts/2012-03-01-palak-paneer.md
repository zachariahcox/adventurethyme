## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 pound | fresh spinach, washed |
| 8 oz | paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes |
| 2 Tbsp | ghee or vegetable oil |
| 1 | medium onion, finely chopped |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh ginger, minced |
| 1-2 | green chilies, minced (adjust to taste) |
| 1 tsp | ground cumin |
| 1 tsp | ground coriander |
| 1/2 tsp | turmeric |
| 1/2 tsp | garam masala |
| 1/4 tsp | cayenne pepper (optional) |
| 1/2 cup | plain yogurt |
| 2 Tbsp | heavy cream |
| 1 tsp | salt, or to taste |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh lemon juice |
| 2 Tbsp | chopped fresh cilantro (for garnish) |

## Instructions

1. Blanch spinach in boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.
2. Drain the cooled spinach and blend in a food processor until smooth. Set aside.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil in a non-stick pan. Fry paneer cubes until golden brown on all sides. Remove and set aside.
4. In the same pan, heat the remaining ghee or oil. Add onions and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.
5. Add garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
6. Add cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and cayenne (if using). Stir and cook for 30 seconds.
7. Add the puréed spinach and salt. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
8. Reduce heat to low and stir in yogurt, a little at a time to prevent curdling.
9. Add the fried paneer cubes and simmer for 5 minutes.
10. Stir in heavy cream and lemon juice.
11. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with naan or rice.
