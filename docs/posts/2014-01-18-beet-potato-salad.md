_Serves 4-6 as a side dish_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 3 | medium beets |
| 1 lb | small red potatoes |
| 1/4 cup | red onion, finely chopped |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh dill, chopped |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh parsley, chopped |
| 2 Tbsp | white wine vinegar |
| 1 Tbsp | Dijon mustard |
| 3 Tbsp | olive oil |
| | Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Wrap beets individually in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Roast until tender when pierced with a knife, about 45-60 minutes depending on size.
2. Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.
3. When beets are cool enough to handle, peel and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. 
4. Drain potatoes and when cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (you can leave the skin on).
5. In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, olive oil, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.
6. In a large bowl, combine beets, potatoes, red onion, dill, and parsley.
7. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.
8. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

_Note: The beets will color the potatoes pink - this is normal and adds to the visual appeal of the dish._
