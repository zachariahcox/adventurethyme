_Flavorful Thai-inspired curry with sweet potatoes and chicken_
_Serves 4-6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 Tbsp | coconut oil |
| 1 | large onion, diced |
| 3 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh ginger, minced |
| 2-3 Tbsp | Thai red curry paste |
| 1 lb | boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces |
| 2 | medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 3 cups) |
| 1 | red bell pepper, sliced |
| 2 (14 oz) cans | coconut milk |
| 2 Tbsp | fish sauce |
| 1 Tbsp | brown sugar |
| 1 | lime, juiced |
| 1 cup | snap peas or green beans |
| 1/4 cup | fresh basil leaves, torn (Thai basil preferred) |
| 1/4 cup | fresh cilantro, chopped |
| | Cooked jasmine rice, for serving |
| | Lime wedges, for serving |

## Instructions

1. Heat coconut oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Stir in the curry paste and cook for 1 minute to release the flavors.
4. Add the chicken pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink on the outside, about 5 minutes.
5. Add sweet potatoes and bell pepper. Stir to coat with the curry mixture.
6. Pour in the coconut milk, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Stir to combine.
7. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the sweet potatoes are tender.
8. Add the snap peas or green beans and cook for another 3-5 minutes until just tender.
9. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice, basil, and half the cilantro.
10. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
11. Serve over jasmine rice, garnished with remaining cilantro and lime wedges.

_Note: For a vegetarian version, omit the chicken and fish sauce (substitute with soy sauce or salt) and add an extra cup of vegetables like mushrooms or cauliflower._
