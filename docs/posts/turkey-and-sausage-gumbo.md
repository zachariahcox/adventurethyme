#### Serves 4 to 6

#### Ingredients



*   3 T plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
*   6 T  all-purpose flour
*   2 (8-ounce) bottles clam juice
*   1 cup water
*   1/2 pound andouille sausage (or kielbasa), cut into 1/2-inch pieces
*   1 onion, minced
*   1 red bell pepper, cored and chopped fine
*   1 celery rib, chopped fine
*   1 (16-ounce) package frozen okra, thawed
*   2 teaspoons Creole spice mixture, such as Zatarain's or Emeril's
*   1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, or 1/4 teaspoon dried
*   Salt and ground black pepper
*   4 garlic cloves, minced
*   1 pound shredded cooked turkey or chicken (great use of leftover thanksgiving turkey)
*   3 scallions, sliced thin

#### Instructions

1.  Prepare the sausage, onion, bell pepper, and celery while the roux browns 
2.  **MAKE THE ROUX AND SAUCE:** Whisk 3 tablespoons of oil and flour together in small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture is color of an old copper penny, about 15 minutes. Slowly whisk in clam juice and water and bring to simmer. Continue to simmer until needed in step 3.
3.  **SAUTÉ SAUSAGE AND VEGETABLES:** While roux cooks, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add andouille, onion, bell pepper, celery, okra, Creole spice mixture, thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4.  **ASSEMBLE GUMBO:** Slowly stir roux mixture into vegetables, scraping up any browned bits. Add turkey/chicken. Simmer until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 ­minutes.
5.  Off heat, season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with scallions before serving.
