_Serves 8-10_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4-5 pounds | beef brisket |
| 2 Tbsp | vegetable oil |
| 2 | large onions, sliced |
| 6 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 cup | beef broth |
| 1/2 cup | red wine (or additional beef broth) |
| 1/4 cup | tomato paste |
| 2 Tbsp | Worcestershire sauce |
| 2 Tbsp | brown sugar |
| 1 Tbsp | paprika |
| 2 tsp | salt |
| 1 tsp | black pepper |
| 1 tsp | dried thyme |
| 2 | bay leaves |
| 2 Tbsp | cornstarch (optional, for thickening gravy) |
| 2 Tbsp | cold water (optional, for thickening gravy) |

## Instructions

1. Trim excess fat from brisket, leaving a thin layer on one side.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown brisket on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to slow cooker.
3. In the same skillet, add onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute. 
4. Add beef broth to the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
5. Stir in red wine, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, and thyme. Bring to a simmer.
6. Pour the onion mixture over the brisket in the slow cooker. Add bay leaves.
7. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours, or on high for 4-5 hours, until the brisket is very tender.
8. Remove brisket from slow cooker and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
9. Optional: To thicken the gravy, remove bay leaves and skim excess fat from the liquid. Mix cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl, then stir into the liquid in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high for 15 minutes until thickened.
10. Serve sliced brisket with the gravy and onions.
