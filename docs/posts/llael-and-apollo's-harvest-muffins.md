1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or spray with non-stick cooking spray.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add brown sugar, oil, apple sauce, and vanilla. Mix until well combined.
4. Fold in the grated zucchini and carrots.
5. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not overmix.
6. Gently fold in the diced apple, dried cranberries, and nuts.
7. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. If desired, sprinkle the tops with rolled oats.
8. Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
9. Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

_Note: These muffins freeze well. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months._
