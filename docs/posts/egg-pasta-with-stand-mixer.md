#### Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
|  | : |


*   4C flour
*   3/4 t salt
*   2 t olive oil
*   3 large eggs
*   ? water

#### Directions: 

1.  In a measuring cup, combine salt, olive oil and eggs. 
2.  Add water until total amount of liquid measures 1.3 C. This measurement is accurate for a standard North Carolina day. The actual correct amount of liquid will need to be adjusted up or down depending upon humidity (subtract 1T for a humid day, 2T or 3T if it is raining, etc). 
3.  Add flour to stand mixer and attach the mixing / batter attachment (not a dough hook). 
4.  Set the mixer to low speed, and slowly add the egg mixture in a steady stream. 
5.  Allow the ingredients to fully combine (a minute or two). 
6.  Stop the mixer, replace the batter attachment with a dough hook, and allow the dough hook to knead for at least 15 minutes. Observe the consistency of the dough and add additional water or flour in (at maximum) 1T increments. Allow each increment to fully incorporate before reevaluating. 
7.  When dough has reached correct consistency, remove from mixer, divide evenly into two pieces, shape each piece into a ball and wrap dough balls tightly in plastic wrap. 
8.  Place dough in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days, or in freezer for up to 3 weeks.
