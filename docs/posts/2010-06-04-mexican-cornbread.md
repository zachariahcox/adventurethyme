## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 cup | yellow cornmeal |
| 1 cup | all-purpose flour |
| 1/4 cup | sugar |
| 4 tsp | baking powder |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1 cup | buttermilk |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or a 10-inch cast-iron skillet.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then stir in buttermilk and oil.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined.
5. Fold in the cream-style corn, cheeses, green chilies, jalapeños, bell pepper, and onion.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish or skillet.
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Let cool for 10 minutes before cutting into squares.

_Serving suggestion: This cornbread pairs perfectly with chili, or can be served as a side dish with any Mexican-inspired meal._
