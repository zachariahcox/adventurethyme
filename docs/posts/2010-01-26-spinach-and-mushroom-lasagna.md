## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. For the mushroom layer: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
4. Add mushrooms, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms release their moisture and it evaporates, about 10-12 minutes.
5. Stir in parsley and remove from heat. Set aside.
6. For the spinach-ricotta layer: In a large bowl, combine the squeezed spinach, ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and basil. Mix well.
7. To assemble: Spread 1/3 of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
8. Layer 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping.
9. Spread half of the spinach-ricotta mixture over the noodles.
10. Spread half of the mushroom mixture over the spinach-ricotta layer.
11. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese.
12. Repeat layers: Add another 1/3 of the marinara sauce, 4 more noodles, remaining spinach-ricotta mixture, remaining mushroom mixture, and another 1/3 of the mozzarella.
13. Top with the remaining 4 noodles, remaining marinara sauce, remaining mozzarella, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
14. Cover with foil (tent it slightly so it doesn't touch the cheese) and bake for 40 minutes.
15. Remove foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.
16. Let rest for 15 minutes before cutting and serving.
