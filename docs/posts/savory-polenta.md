_Serves 4-6 as a side dish_

## Ingredients


| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4 cups | water or chicken broth |
| 1 tsp | salt |
| 1 cup | coarse cornmeal (polenta) |
| 2 Tbsp | butter |
| 1/2 cup | grated Parmesan cheese |
| 1/4 tsp | freshly ground black pepper |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, or sage), chopped (optional) |

## Instructions


1. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, bring water or broth to a boil. Add salt.
2. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
3. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, for about 30-40 minutes. The polenta should pull away from the sides of the pot when it's done.
4. Remove from heat and stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, pepper, and fresh herbs if using.
5. For soft polenta: Serve immediately in bowls.
6. For firm polenta: Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish and let cool until firm. Cut into squares and saut√© or grill until crispy on the outside.

_Serving suggestion: Top with roasted vegetables, braised meat, or a simple tomato sauce._
