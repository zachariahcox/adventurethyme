## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add butternut squash, apples, broth, water, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cayenne (if using). Bring to a boil.
3. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until squash and apples are very tender, about 20-25 minutes.

5. Purée the soup using an immersion blender, or in batches in a blender or food processor until smooth.
