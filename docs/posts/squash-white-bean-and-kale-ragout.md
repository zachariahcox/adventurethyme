Published by: NY Times, November 14, 2007 Time: 1 1/4 hours 

  

1 3-pound butternut squash

2 tablespoons unsalted butter 

2 tablespoons maple syrup 

2 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar 

1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste 

1 teaspoon ground black pepper 

Pinch of cayenne 

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 

4 large leeks, cleaned and chopped, white and light green parts only 

2 large garlic cloves, pressed 

2-3 large rosemary sprigs (remove twigs after cooking)

2 15-ounce cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 

2 cups vegetable broth 

1.5 bunches kale, center ribs removed, leaves thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 bunches or 1 large farmer's market bunch) 

2 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (with box grater, not microplane) ( 1/2 cup), more to taste

1/3 cup dried cranberries, roughly chopped, plus whole berries for garnish 

  

1\. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, peel pumpkin or squash. Trim stem, then halve pumpkin or squash and scoop out seeds (save for roasting if desired). Cut flesh into 1-inch cubes. 

  

2\. Spread cubes out on a large rimmed baking sheet. In small saucepan, combine butter or canola oil, syrup, 1 teaspoon vinegar, kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cayenne. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until butter melts; pour mixture over squash and toss to coat evenly. Roast, tossing occasionally, until pumpkin or squash is very tender and caramelized at edges, about 30 minutes. 

  

3\. In a large skillet, warm olive oil over medium heat. Add leeks, garlic, rosemary and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are very soft and not at all browned, about 15 minutes. Add beans and broth and simmer for 10 minutes. 

  

4\. Stir in kale, and cheese if desired. Simmer until kale is cooked down and very tender, about 10 minutes. 

  

5\. Stir in pumpkin or squash and chopped cranberries; season with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Garnish with additional cranberries and sea salt, and serve. 

  

Yield: 8 to 10 side-dish servings; 6 main-course servings.

  

Delicious; and an instant thanksgiving classic. Make sure not to skimp on the cider vinegar and maple syrup, more cayenne pepper would be easily tolerated by most.
