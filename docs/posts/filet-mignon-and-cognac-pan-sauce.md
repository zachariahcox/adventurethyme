INGREDIENTS



*   4center cut filet mignons, 1 1/2 inches thick, 7 to 8 ounces each, dried thoroughly with paper towels
*   4-8teaspoons olive oil (try 2t per steak to prevent burning)
*   salt and ground pepper

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  1\. Place rimmed baking sheet on lower middle position in oven rack, and heat oven to 450 degrees. When oven reaches 450 degrees, heat 10-inch heavy-bottomed skillet (not nonstick) over medium or medium high heat on stovetop until very hot, about 2-3 minutes (do NOT heat on high in our stainless steel pan - the steaks will burn).
    
2.  2\. Meanwhile, rub each side of steaks with 1/2 or 1 teaspoon oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place steaks in skillet and cook, without moving steaks, until well-browned and a nice crust has formed, about 3 minutes. Turn steaks with tongs and cook until well-browned and a nice crust has formed on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Remove pan from heat, and use tongs to transfer steaks to hot baking sheet in oven.
    
3.  3\. Roast 2 to 4 minutes for very rare (cherry red center), **4 to 6 minutes for rare** (red centers), or 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare (pink centers). Transfer steaks to large plate; loosely tent with foil, and let rest about 5 minutes before serving.
    
      
    
    After transferring steaks to oven, proceed with the pan sauce:
    
      
    
    #### INGREDIENTS for 4 steaks
    
    *   2shallots or  some red onion, really minced or put through garlic press (about 1/4 cup)
    *   1teaspoon brown sugar
    *   1/4cup Cognac
    *   3/4cup chicken broth
    *   1tablespoon lemon juice
    *   1tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon whole grain mustard
    *   3tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
    *   2teaspoons minced fresh tarragon leaves
    *   salt and ground pepper
    
    #### INSTRUCTIONS
    
    1.  1\. To the same skillet used to cook steaks (do not clean skillet or discard accumulated fat), add shallots and sugar off heat; using pan’s residual heat, cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are slightly softened and browned and sugar is melted, about 45 seconds.  
        2\. Return skillet to high heat, add cognac and broth; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits on pan bottom with wooden spoon. Boil until liquid is reduced to 1/3 cup, about 4 minutes.  
        3\. Add lemon juice and mustard; cook to blend flavors, about 1 minute longer.  
        4\. Off heat, whisk in butter until melted and sauce is thickened and glossy. Add tarragon and season to taste with salt and pepper; spoon over steaks and serve immediately.
        
          
        Notes:
        
        _\- This sauce comes out rather sweet and would be good over poultry or pork as well. Maybe tone this down for filet mignon: less mustard and more chicken broth._
