| 1 pound | chopped kale, collards, chard, or spinach (about 2 bags or 1 large farmer's market bag) |

|  | INSTRUCTIONS |
|  | 1\. Put 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large dutch oven over medium heat. When it’s hot, add onion, carrot, celery and garlic; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. |
|  | 2\. Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Add beans, tomatoes, stock, rosemary and thyme to pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer; cover and cook 15 to 20 minutes, stirring once or twice to break up the tomatoes. |
|  | 3\. Stir in the greens. Toast bread and lay slices on top of the stew so they cover the top. Scatter red onion slices over the top, drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. |
|  | 4\. Put the pot in the oven and bake until the bread, onions and cheese are browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. |
