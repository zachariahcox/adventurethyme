## Ingredients


### Berry Filling

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6 cups | mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries) |
| 3/4 cup | granulated sugar |
| 2 Tbsp | cornstarch |
| 2 Tbsp | lemon juice |
| 1 tsp | lemon zest |
| 1/4 tsp | ground cinnamon |

### Cobbler Topping

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 1/2 cups | all-purpose flour |
| 1/3 cup | granulated sugar |
| 1 1/2 tsp | baking powder |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1/2 cup (1 stick) | cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces |
| 1/2 cup | buttermilk |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract |
| 1 Tbsp | coarse sugar (for sprinkling) |

## Instructions


1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. For the filling: In a large bowl, gently toss berries with sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cinnamon until well combined. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
3. For the topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
4. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
5. Stir in buttermilk and vanilla just until a shaggy dough forms.
6. Drop spoonfuls of the dough over the berry mixture. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.
7. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges.
8. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream if desired.
