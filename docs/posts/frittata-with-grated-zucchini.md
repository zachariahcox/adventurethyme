_Serves 4-6_

## Ingredients


| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 | medium zucchini, grated (about 2 cups) |
| 1/4 tsp | salt |
| 8 | large eggs |
| 2 Tbsp | milk |
| 1/4 tsp | black pepper |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 | small onion, finely chopped |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1/2 cup | grated Parmesan cheese |
| 1/4 cup | chopped fresh basil |
| 1/4 cup | chopped fresh parsley |
| 1/2 cup | crumbled feta cheese |

## Instructions


1. Place grated zucchini in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 10 minutes, then squeeze out excess moisture with your hands or by pressing with paper towels.
2. In a large bowl, beat eggs with milk, and season with pepper.
3. Heat olive oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds more.
4. Add the squeezed zucchini to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the egg mixture. Stir gently to distribute the zucchini evenly. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese, basil, and parsley over the top.
6. Cook without stirring until the edges are set but the center is still runny, about 5-7 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler.
8. Sprinkle the feta cheese over the top of the frittata and place the skillet under the broiler. Broil until the top is set and lightly golden, 2-3 minutes.
9. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.
