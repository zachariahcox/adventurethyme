_Serves 6-8 as a side dish_

## Ingredients


| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 lb | dried black beans, soaked overnight |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 | large onion, diced |
| 1 | green bell pepper, diced |
| 4 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 | jalapeño, seeded and minced |
| 2 tsp | ground cumin |
| 1 tsp | dried oregano |
| 2 | bay leaves |
| 1 Tbsp | tomato paste |
| 6 cups | vegetable broth |
| 1 Tbsp | apple cider vinegar |
| 1/4 cup | fresh cilantro, chopped |
| | Salt and pepper to taste |
| | Lime wedges for serving |

## Instructions


1. Drain and rinse the soaked black beans.
2. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper, and sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Add garlic and jalapeño, and cook for another minute until fragrant.
4. Stir in cumin and oregano, and cook for 30 seconds until aromatic.
5. Add the drained beans, bay leaves, tomato paste, and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer.
6. Cover and cook for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until beans are tender. Check occasionally and add more water if needed.
7. Once the beans are tender, remove about 1 cup of beans and mash them with a fork or potato masher. Return the mashed beans to the pot to thicken the mixture.
8. Stir in apple cider vinegar and continue to simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes more to allow the flavors to blend and the liquid to reduce slightly.
9. Remove bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Stir in chopped cilantro just before serving.
11. Serve with lime wedges.

_Serving suggestion: These beans can be served over rice, as a side dish with tacos, in burritos, or as a soup with additional broth._
