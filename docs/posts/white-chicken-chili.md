2 14 oz cans Navy/great northern/cannellini beans, drained  
1 Large onion, diced

1/4 cup vermouth or dry white wine  
1 Stick butter  
1/4 cup flour  
2 cups chicken broth  
1 cup whole milk  
1+ tsp chili powder

1 lb cooked chicken breast, shredded (rotisserie, broiled or sauteed)

4\. Bring to almost a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.

5\. Add chicken, beans, chillies, and cheese and lightly simmer on medium-low for 20 minutes  
6\. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and cilantro. Serve.
