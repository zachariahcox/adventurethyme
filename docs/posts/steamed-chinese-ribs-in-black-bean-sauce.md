2 lbs pork ribs (country style)

  

Group 1 (combine)

1 T cooking wine

4 T soy sauce

1 T sugar

1 T cornstarch

dash of seseme oil

  

Group 2 (combine)

3 T fermented black beans

1 T chopped garlic

1 T chopped ginger root

5 green onions, diced

5 dried chili peppers, crushed

  

  

\-Cut ribs into small pieces ~ 1 inch on one of the sides. (They can be wide and long, but thin is better)

\-Add combination of group 1 and mix well.

\-Add combination of group 2 and mix well.

  

\- Put meat/sauce mixture into a steamer and steam for 20 minutes.

  

Notes:

\- The smaller pieces seemed to work better with the sauce

\- There seemed to be a lot of fat, I am not sure if it actually affected the cooking at all. Try cleaning more of the fat away next time
