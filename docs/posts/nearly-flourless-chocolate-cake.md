_Rich, decadent chocolate cake with minimal flour_
_Serves 8-10_

## Ingredients


### Cake

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 8 oz | high-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped |
| 1 cup (2 sticks) | unsalted butter |
| 1 1/4 cups | granulated sugar |
| 6 | large eggs |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract |
| 1/4 cup | all-purpose flour |
| 1/4 tsp | salt |
| 2 Tbsp | cocoa powder |

### Ganache (Optional)

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4 oz | dark chocolate, chopped |
| 1/2 cup | heavy cream |
| 1 Tbsp | unsalted butter |
| | Fresh berries, for serving (optional) |
| | Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional) |

## Instructions


1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Wrap the outside of the pan with aluminum foil to prevent leakage.

2. In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (or in a microwave in 30-second intervals), melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

3. In a large bowl, whisk together sugar and eggs until well combined. Gradually whisk in the melted chocolate mixture and vanilla extract.

4. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and cocoa powder. Fold this dry mixture into the chocolate-egg mixture until just combined.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

6. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly. The cake will continue to set as it cools.

7. Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, about 1-2 hours. The cake will sink slightly in the center as it cools - this is normal.

8. For the ganache (if using): Heat heavy cream until it just begins to simmer. Pour over chopped chocolate and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Stir until smooth, then add butter and stir until incorporated. Allow to cool slightly until it reaches spreading consistency.

9. Remove the cake from the springform pan and place on a serving plate. Pour or spread ganache over the top if using, or simply dust with powdered sugar.

10. Serve at room temperature or chilled, with fresh berries if desired.

_Note: This cake is even better the day after baking, as the flavors have time to develop._
