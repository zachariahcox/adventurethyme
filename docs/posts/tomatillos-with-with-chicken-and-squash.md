## Ingredients


| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 medium | boneless, skinless chicken breast (6 to 8 ounces) |
| 1 pound | fresh tomatillos, husked and rinsed |
| 3 | serrano chilies |
| 1/2 cup | chopped onion, soaked for five minutes in cold water, then drained |
| 5 large | garlic cloves, peeled |
| 12 | cilantro sprigs, plus additional chopped cilantro for garnish |
| 2 1/2 cups | chicken stock |
| 2 medium | summer squash, diced (we used zucchini this time) |
| 8 | corn tortillas, toasted in a microwave or in an oven and broken into small pieces |
| 1/2 cup | crumbled queso fresco |

## Instructions


1. Fry the chicken and shred.
2. Bring the tomatillos to a simmer in a saucepan. Simmer 10 minutes, turning them over halfway through. Drain and place in a blender. Add the chilies, chopped onion, garlic, salt and cilantro sprigs. Blend until smooth.
3. Heat the oil in the skillet you fried the chicken in, over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a drop of oil to test the heat. If it sizzles and sputters immediately, the oil is hot enough. Add the tomatillo pur√©e and stir constantly until it thickens and begins to stick to the pan, about five minutes. When you run your spoon down the middle of the pan it should leave a canal. Stir in the stock, bring to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes, stirring often. Add the summer squash and simmer, stirring often, until tender, about 10 minutes. The sauce should coat the front and back of your spoon. Stir in the chicken and heat through. Adjust seasoning. Just before serving bring to a simmer and stir in the tortilla chips. Garnish with the cheese, and chopped cilantro. Serve immediately.

_Yield: Serves four._
