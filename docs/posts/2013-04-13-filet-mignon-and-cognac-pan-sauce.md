_Serves 2_

## Ingredients

### Steaks
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 | filet mignon steaks (6-8 oz each), about 1½ inches thick |
| | Kosher salt |
| | Freshly ground black pepper |
| 1 Tbsp | vegetable oil |
| 2 Tbsp | unsalted butter |
| 2 | garlic cloves, smashed |
| 2-3 sprigs | fresh thyme |

### Cognac Pan Sauce
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 | shallot, finely minced |
| 1/4 cup | cognac or brandy |
| 3/4 cup | beef stock |
| 2 Tbsp | unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh parsley, chopped |
| | Salt and pepper to taste |

## Instructions

1. Remove steaks from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature.
2. Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.
3. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil.
4. Carefully place steaks in the hot skillet and cook without moving for 3 minutes to develop a crust.
5. Flip the steaks and add butter, garlic cloves, and thyme sprigs to the pan. Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter for about 2-3 minutes.
6. For medium-rare (internal temperature of 130-135°F), cook for a total of about 5-6 minutes, depending on thickness. Adjust cooking time for different doneness levels.
7. Transfer steaks to a plate and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5-10 minutes.
8. While steaks are resting, make the sauce: Reduce heat to medium and add shallot to the same pan. Cook until softened, about 1 minute.
9. Carefully add cognac (it may flame up, which is normal). Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
10. When cognac is reduced by half, add beef stock. Bring to a simmer and reduce by half, about 3-4 minutes.
11. Remove from heat and whisk in cold butter pieces one at a time until sauce is smooth and glossy.
12. Stir in chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.
13. Serve steaks with the cognac sauce spooned over the top.

_Serving suggestion: Pair with roasted potatoes and asparagus for a classic steakhouse dinner._
