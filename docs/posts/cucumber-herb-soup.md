_Refreshing cold soup for summer_
_Serves 4-6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 lbs | cucumbers (about 4 medium), peeled, seeded, and chopped |
| 1 cup | plain Greek yogurt |
| 1/2 cup | sour cream |
| 1/4 cup | fresh dill, chopped |
| 1/4 cup | fresh mint leaves, chopped |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh chives, chopped |
| 2 | green onions, white and light green parts, chopped |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 2 Tbsp | lemon juice |
| 2 Tbsp | white wine vinegar |
| 1/4 cup | olive oil |
| 1/2 tsp | salt, or to taste |
| 1/4 tsp | freshly ground black pepper |
| | Diced cucumber, fresh herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil for garnish |

## Instructions

1. Reserve about 1/2 cup of chopped cucumber for garnish.
2. In a blender or food processor, combine the remaining cucumbers, yogurt, sour cream, dill, mint, chives, green onions, and garlic.
3. Blend until smooth.
4. Add lemon juice, white wine vinegar, and olive oil. Blend again to incorporate.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow flavors to develop.
7. Before serving, taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If the soup is too thick, thin with cold water or additional yogurt.
8. Serve chilled, garnished with reserved diced cucumber, additional fresh herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil.

_Note: For a more elegant presentation, strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve before chilling for a smoother texture._
