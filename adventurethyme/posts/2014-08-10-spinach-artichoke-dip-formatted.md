_Creamy, cheesy hot dip perfect for parties_
_Serves 8-10 as an appetizer_

## Ingredients

### Topping
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 slices | white bread, quartered |
| 2 Tbsp | grated Parmesan cheese |
| 1 Tbsp | unsalted butter, melted |

### Dip
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 (14-ounce) can | artichoke quarters |
| 1 (10-ounce) package | frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 | medium onion, minced |
| 2 tsp | pressed garlic |
| 3/4 cup | mayonnaise |
| 6 ounces | cream cheese (room temperature) |
| 1 ounce | Parmesan cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup) |
| 2 Tbsp | juice from 1 lemon |
| 1 Tbsp | minced fresh thyme leaves |
| 1 pinch | cayenne pepper |

## Instructions

1. **FOR THE TOPPING:** Pulse the bread in a food processor to coarse crumbs. Toss the bread crumbs with the Parmesan and butter.
2. **FOR THE DIP:** Process the artichokes in a food processor until finely chopped, about 8 1-second pulses; transfer to a medium bowl.
3. Add the spinach to the artichokes and stir to combine; set aside.
4. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer the mixture to the bowl with the artichokes and spinach and set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne to the bowl and stir to combine. Transfer the mixture to a 1-quart shallow ovenproof dish.
6. Preheat the broiler. Sprinkle the bread-crumb mixture over the spinach mixture and broil until the top is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

_Serving suggestion: Serve with tortilla chips, pita chips, or toasted baguette slices._
