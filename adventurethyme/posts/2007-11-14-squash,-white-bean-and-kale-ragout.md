_Hearty vegetarian stew perfect for fall_
_Serves 6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 | medium onion, chopped |
| 3 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 | medium butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 4 cups) |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh sage, chopped (or 1 tsp dried) |
| 1 tsp | dried rosemary |
| 1/2 tsp | red pepper flakes |
| 4 cups | vegetable broth |
| 2 (15 oz) cans | cannellini beans, drained and rinsed |
| 1 bunch | kale, stems removed and leaves roughly chopped (about 6 cups) |
| 1 (14.5 oz) can | diced tomatoes |
| 2 Tbsp | lemon juice |
| | Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste |
| 1/4 cup | grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional) |
| | Crusty bread, for serving |

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add butternut squash, sage, rosemary, and red pepper flakes. Stir to coat the squash with oil and spices.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, or until squash is just tender when pierced with a fork.
5. Add the drained beans, kale, and diced tomatoes with their juice. Stir to combine.
6. Simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the kale is tender and the flavors have melded.
7. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan if desired, and crusty bread on the side.

_Note: This ragout gets even better if made a day ahead and reheated, as the flavors have more time to develop._
