*   6 Seville oranges (or 5 navel oranges + juice of 1 lemon)
*   ½ cup Demerara sugar
*   1 bottle red wine (not too dry nor too sweet)
*   1 bottle Ruby port
*   30 cloves
*   5 dried green cardamom pods
*    Orange peel for garnish
*     
    

1.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Prepare oranges (not lemons!) for roasting: wash and dry them well, and stud each fruit equally with cloves. Roast the clove-studded fruits in the oven for an hour, then transfer them to a large glass or ceramic bowl.
2.  Add the sugar and the red wine (do not add the port yet) to the bowl. Cover the bowl and leave it in a warm spot in the kitchen for at least 12 hours, and up to 24.
3.  After the citrus-sugar-wine mixture has rested, cut the fruits in half and juice them through a strainer into the wine and sugar mixture. Discard fruits after they have been juiced. Strain the mixture again, this time into a heavy saucepan. Discard solids.
4.  Add the port, the cinnamon stick, and the cardamom pods to the saucepan, and heat very slowly—until it “smokes” (the vapors rise), hence the name; do not allow it to boil.
5.  Once the Bishop is as hot as you like, turn off the heat. Remove the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods. Serve in warmed, heatproof glasses, garnished with orange peel.
