_Serves 4-6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 | medium onion, chopped |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 2 pounds | broccoli, stems peeled and chopped, florets separated |
| 4 cups | vegetable or chicken broth |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1/4 tsp | black pepper |
| 1/4 tsp | ground nutmeg |
| 1/2 cup | heavy cream or half-and-half |
| | Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional) |
| | Croutons, for serving (optional) |

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add broccoli stems, broth, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Add broccoli florets and simmer for another 10 minutes, until all broccoli is very tender.
5. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. 
6. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, transfer soup in batches to a blender and puree (be careful with hot liquid).
7. Return soup to the pot if using a blender. Stir in cream and heat gently over low heat.
8. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
9. Serve hot, garnished with grated Parmesan and croutons if desired.
