_Serves 4 as a side dish_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 bunches | hearty greens (collards, kale, or mustard greens) |
| 3 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 4 cloves | garlic, thinly sliced |
| 1/2 tsp | red pepper flakes |
| 1/2 cup | chicken or vegetable broth |
| 2 Tbsp | apple cider vinegar |
| 1 tsp | honey or sugar |
| | Salt and freshly ground black pepper |
| | Lemon wedges for serving (optional) |

## Instructions

1. Remove the tough stems from the greens and slice the leaves into 1-inch wide strips. Wash thoroughly and drain, but leave some water clinging to the leaves.
2. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until garlic is fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute.
3. Add the damp greens to the pot a handful at a time, stirring to coat with oil. As they wilt, add more until all greens are in the pot.
4. Pour in the broth, vinegar, and honey or sugar. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-30 minutes for collards, or 10-15 minutes for kale or mustard greens, until tender. The cooking time will vary depending on the type of greens used.
6. Uncover, increase heat to medium, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 more minutes.
7. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
8. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side if desired.

_Note: For a Southern-style variation, add 1/4 pound of diced bacon or ham at the beginning, and cook until crisp before adding the garlic._
