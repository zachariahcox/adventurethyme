_Serves 3-4 as part of a Chinese meal_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 1/2 pounds | pork spare ribs, cut into 1-2 inch pieces |
| 2 Tbsp | fermented black beans, rinsed and mashed |
| 3 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 Tbsp | ginger, minced |
| 2 Tbsp | soy sauce |
| 1 Tbsp | Chinese rice wine or dry sherry |
| 1 tsp | sugar |
| 1/2 tsp | sesame oil |
| 1 Tbsp | vegetable oil |
| 2 | green onions, sliced (for garnish) |
| 1 | red chili, sliced (optional) |

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine the black beans, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, sesame oil, and vegetable oil to make the sauce.
2. Place the spare ribs in a large bowl and pour the sauce over them. Mix well to coat each piece thoroughly.
3. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
4. Prepare a steamer by bringing water to a boil in the bottom pot.
5. Arrange the ribs in a single layer on a heatproof plate that fits in your steamer, pouring any excess marinade over the ribs.
6. Place the plate in the steamer, cover, and steam over medium-high heat for 45-50 minutes, until the ribs are tender.
7. Garnish with sliced green onions and red chili slices if desired before serving.
