_Serves 4 as a side dish_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 pound | fresh okra |
| 3 Tbsp | vegetable oil |
| 1 tsp | cumin seeds |
| 1 | medium onion, thinly sliced |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 tsp | fresh ginger, minced |
| 1 tsp | ground coriander |
| 1/2 tsp | ground cumin |
| 1/4 tsp | turmeric |
| 1/4 tsp | cayenne pepper (adjust to taste) |
| 1 tsp | salt |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh lemon juice |
| 2 Tbsp | chopped fresh cilantro |

## Instructions

1. Wash okra and pat completely dry with paper towels. Trim the ends and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add sliced onions and cook until they begin to turn golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.
4. Add garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute.
5. Add the okra and stir to coat with the oil. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the okra is tender and the sliminess has reduced.
6. Add coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Stir well to combine.
7. Continue cooking for another 3-5 minutes until the okra is well-cooked but not mushy.
8. Remove from heat and sprinkle with lemon juice and fresh cilantro.
9. Serve warm as a side dish with Indian bread or rice.
