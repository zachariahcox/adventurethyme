|  | 2\. Saute the onions, celery, and carrots in 2 tsp oil until lightly browned. Add garlic, then the wine and cook about 1 minute. Add 1 cup of the beef broth, the chicken broth, brown sugar, tomato paste, bay leaves, and thyme; bring to a boil. Transfer to the slow cooker. |
|  | 3\. Cover and cook (low for 8-9hrs, or high for 5-6hrs |
|  | 4\. Transfer the brisket to a carving board and tent loosely with foil. Set the slow cooker to high. Whisk the flour with the remaining ¾ cup of beef broth until smooth, then stir it into the slow cooker. Continue to cook on high until the sauce has thickened and no longer tastes of flour, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice the brisket thin across the grain. Serve with sauce and vegetables. |
