#### Serves 6 to 8

#### Ingredients



#### _Stew_

*   Shredded chicken off of one rotisserie/roasted chicken (or leftover thanksgiving turkey!)
*   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
*   2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, cut in half lengthwise and then into 1-inch pieces
*   1 large onion, minced
*   6 tablespoon  all-purpose flour
*   1/4 cup dry sherry
*   4 1/2 cups  chicken broth
*   1/4 cup whole milk
*   1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
*   2 bay leaves
*   1 cup frozen green peas
*   3 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon leaves 

 _Dumplings_  

*   2 cups  all-purpose flour
*   1 tablespoon baking powder
*   1 teaspoon table salt
*   1 cup whole milk
*   3 tablespoons unsalted butter

#### Instructions

1.  Add the butter to the Dutch oven and melt over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, onion, and a pinch of salt and cook until softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in the flour. Whisk in the sherry, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the broth, milk, thyme, and bay leaves. Add chicken and simmer while you prepare the dumplings.
2.  **For the Dumplings (concurrent with step 1):** Stir the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Microwave the milk and butter in a microwave-safe bowl on high until just warm (do not over-heat), about 1 minute. Stir the warmed milk mixture into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon until incorporated and smooth.
3.  Stir the peas and tarragon into the stew, and season with pepper. Drop large-marble-sized dumplings over the top of the stew, about 1/4 inch apart. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the dumplings have doubled in size, 15 to 18 minutes. Serve.
