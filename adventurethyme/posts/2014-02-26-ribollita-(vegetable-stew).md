_Traditional Tuscan vegetable and bread soup_
_Serves 6-8_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1/4 cup | olive oil, plus more for serving |
| 1 | large onion, chopped |
| 2 | carrots, diced |
| 2 | celery stalks, diced |
| 4 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 tsp | dried oregano |
| 1 tsp | dried thyme |
| 1/4 tsp | red pepper flakes |
| 1 (28 oz) can | diced tomatoes |
| 6 cups | vegetable or chicken broth |
| 1 | Parmesan rind (optional) |
| 2 (15 oz) cans | cannellini beans, drained and rinsed |
| 1 bunch | kale or cavolo nero, stems removed and leaves chopped |
| 1/2 loaf | day-old crusty bread, torn into chunks |
| | Salt and freshly ground black pepper |
| | Grated Parmesan cheese for serving |
| | Fresh basil for garnish (optional) |

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until vegetables are softened, about 8-10 minutes.
2. Add garlic, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add diced tomatoes with their juice, broth, and Parmesan rind if using. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
4. Add cannellini beans and kale. Simmer for another 15-20 minutes until kale is tender.
5. Add torn bread pieces to the soup and stir until they begin to break down and thicken the soup, about 5-10 minutes.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Remove Parmesan rind before serving.
8. Ladle into bowls and drizzle with olive oil. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil if desired.

_Note: Traditional ribollita is even better the next day. The name "ribollita" means "reboiled" in Italian, as the soup was traditionally reheated the day after it was made._
