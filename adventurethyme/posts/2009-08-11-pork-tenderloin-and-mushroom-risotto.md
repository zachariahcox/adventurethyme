| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 (1 to 1.5 lb) | pork tenderloin |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh rosemary, chopped |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh thyme, chopped |
| 3 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 tsp | salt |
| 1/2 tsp | freshly ground black pepper |

### Mushroom Risotto
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6 cups | chicken broth |
| 2 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 Tbsp | butter |
| 1 | medium onion, finely diced |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 8 oz | mushrooms (cremini or button), sliced |
| 1 1/2 cups | Arborio rice |
| 1/2 cup | dry white wine |
| 1/2 cup | freshly grated Parmesan cheese |
| 2 Tbsp | fresh parsley, chopped |
| | Salt and pepper to taste |

## Instructions

### For the Pork Tenderloin
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. In a small bowl, combine rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper.
3. Rub the pork tenderloin with olive oil, then coat evenly with the herb mixture.
4. Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the pork on all sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side.
5. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F.
6. Remove from the oven, tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

### For the Mushroom Risotto
1. In a saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a simmer, then reduce heat to low to keep warm.
2. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.
3. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Add garlic and mushrooms, and cook until mushrooms are softened and have released their moisture, about 5-6 minutes.
5. Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat with oil, toasting for about 2 minutes until the edges become translucent.
6. Pour in the white wine and stir until almost completely absorbed.
7. Begin adding the warm broth, one ladle (about 1/2 cup) at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed before adding the next.
8. Continue this process for about 18-20 minutes, until the rice is creamy and tender, but still has a slight bite (al dente).
9. Remove from heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Cover and let rest for 2 minutes before serving.

### To Serve
1. Slice the pork tenderloin into medallions.
2. Spoon the risotto onto plates and arrange the pork slices on top or alongside.
3. Garnish with additional parsley and Parmesan if desired.

_Note: The key to perfect risotto is adding the broth gradually and stirring frequently to develop the creamy texture._
