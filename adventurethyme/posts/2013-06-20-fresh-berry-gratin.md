_Serves 6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6 cups | mixed fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries) |
| 1/4 cup | granulated sugar |
| 1 Tbsp | fresh lemon juice |
| 1/4 cup | orange liqueur (Grand Marnier or Cointreau) |
| 3/4 cup | heavy cream |
| 1/3 cup | confectioners' sugar |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract |
| 1/2 cup | sour cream |
| | Mint leaves for garnish (optional) |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the broiler.
2. Gently toss berries with granulated sugar, lemon juice, and orange liqueur in a large bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes to allow flavors to combine.
3. Divide the berries among 6 individual gratin dishes or ramekins. Place on a baking sheet.
4. In a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream with an electric mixer until it begins to thicken. Add confectioners' sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until soft peaks form.
5. Fold in the sour cream until just combined.
6. Spoon the cream mixture over the berries, spreading to cover completely.
7. Place under the broiler until the top is lightly browned, about 1-2 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
8. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with mint leaves if desired.

_Note: Can be prepared a few hours ahead. Complete steps 1-6, refrigerate, and broil just before serving._
