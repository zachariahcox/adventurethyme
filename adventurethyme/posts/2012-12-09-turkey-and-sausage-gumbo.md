_Serves 8-10_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 cup | vegetable oil |
| 1 cup | all-purpose flour |
| 2 | large onions, chopped |
| 2 | green bell peppers, chopped |
| 4 | celery stalks, chopped |
| 8 | garlic cloves, minced |
| 4 cups | turkey or chicken stock |
| 4 cups | water |
| 1 lb | andouille sausage, sliced |
| 3-4 cups | shredded cooked turkey |
| 2 tsp | dried thyme |
| 2 | bay leaves |
| 1 tsp | cayenne pepper (adjust to taste) |
| | Salt and freshly ground black pepper |
| | Green onions, chopped (for garnish) |
| | Hot cooked rice for serving |

## Instructions

1. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat. Add flour and stir constantly until the roux reaches a deep chocolate brown color, about 20-30 minutes.
2. Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery to the roux and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute.
3. Gradually add the stock and water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
4. Add the sausage, turkey, thyme, bay leaves, and cayenne. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove bay leaves before serving. Serve gumbo over hot rice and garnish with chopped green onions.
