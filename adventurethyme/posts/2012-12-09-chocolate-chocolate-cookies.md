_Makes about 36 cookies_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 cups | all-purpose flour |
| 3/4 cup | unsweetened cocoa powder |
| 1 tsp | baking soda |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1 cup (2 sticks) | unsalted butter, room temperature |
| 2/3 cup | granulated sugar |
| 2/3 cup | light brown sugar, packed |
| 2 | large eggs |
| 2 tsp | vanilla extract |
| 2 cups | semi-sweet chocolate chips |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, beat butter and both sugars with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
4. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla.
5. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating on low speed until just combined.
6. Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts (if using).
7. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheets, spacing cookies about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake until cookies are set around the edges but still soft in the center, about 10-12 minutes.
9. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
