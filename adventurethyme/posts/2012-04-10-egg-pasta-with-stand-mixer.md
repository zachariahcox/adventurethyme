_Makes about 1 pound of pasta_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 cups | all-purpose flour |
| 3 | large eggs |
| 1 tsp | salt |
| 1 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 1-2 Tbsp | water (if needed) |
| | Additional flour for dusting |

## Instructions

1. Attach the flat beater to your stand mixer. Add flour and salt to the mixer bowl and mix briefly on low speed to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and olive oil.
3. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour the egg mixture into the flour.
4. Mix until the dough starts to come together, about 30-60 seconds. If the mixture seems too dry, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time.
5. Replace the flat beater with the dough hook attachment. Knead the dough on medium-low speed for 2 minutes.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 1-2 minutes until smooth and elastic.
7. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.
8. After resting, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Work with one piece at a time, keeping the others wrapped.
9. Flatten one piece of dough and dust with flour. Attach the pasta roller attachment to your stand mixer.
10. Set the roller to the widest setting (usually 1) and run the dough through. Fold the dough in thirds like a letter and run it through again. Repeat this process 3-4 times until the dough is smooth.
11. Gradually decrease the roller setting, running the dough through once at each setting until you reach your desired thickness (usually 5 or 6 for fettuccine).
12. Replace the pasta roller with the cutting attachment (fettuccine, spaghetti, etc.) and run the sheets through to cut.
13. Hang the cut pasta on a pasta drying rack or lay on a floured baking sheet in loose nests.
14. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.
15. Cook fresh pasta in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, or until al dente.

_Note: Fresh pasta can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks._
