#### Serves 6

  

#### Ingredients



*   2 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 2-inch chunks
*   2 T unsalted butter
*   1 leek (or onion), white and green parts only, quartered lengthwise, sliced thin
*   Salt and pepper
*   4 cups vegetable broth[](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/taste_tests/425-vegetable-broth)
*   1 - 2 cups water
*   2 sprigs fresh thyme
*   1 bay leaf
*   pinch cayenne pepper
*   sour cream (optional)

#### Instructions

**1.** Microwave squash in a covered bowl until paring knife glides easily through the flesh, 14 to 18 minutes, stirring halfway through. Transfer squash to colander set in bowl and drain for 5 minutes; reserve liquid.  
  

**2.** Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add squash, leek, and at most 1 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until squash pieces begin to break down and brown fond forms in bottom of pot, 10 to 13 minutes. Make sure not to let it burn at this stage.  
  

**3.** Add 2 cups broth and scrape bottom of pot to incorporate fond. Add the remaining 2 cups broth, reserved squash liquid, 1 cup water, thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and cayenne. Increase heat to high and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until leeks are fully tender, about 6 minutes.  
  

**4.** Remove and discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Use immersion blender to process soup until smooth, thinning with up to 1 cup water. Season with salt and pepper to taste; serve with sour cream if desired.
