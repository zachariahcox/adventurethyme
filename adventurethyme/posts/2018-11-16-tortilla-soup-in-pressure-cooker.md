## Instructions

1. Select "Sauté" function on the pressure cooker. Add oil and heat until shimmering.
2. Add onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeño, and cook for another minute.
3. Stir in chili powder, cumin, and oregano. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Add diced tomatoes with their juice, chicken broth, and chicken breasts. Stir to combine.
5. Secure the lid and set the pressure release valve to "Sealing" position.
6. Select "Pressure Cook" or "Manual" setting and set the cooking time to 10 minutes at high pressure.
7. When the cooking cycle is complete, perform a quick pressure release by carefully turning the valve to "Venting" position.
8. Remove chicken breasts to a cutting board and shred with two forks.
9. Return shredded chicken to the pot. Add black beans, corn, salt, and pepper.
10. Select "Sauté" function and simmer for 3-5 minutes to heat through.
11. Stir in lime juice and turn off the pressure cooker.
12. Meanwhile, for the tortilla strips: Preheat oven to 375°F. Arrange tortilla strips on a baking sheet, spray lightly with cooking spray, and bake for 8-10 minutes until crisp and golden.
13. Serve soup hot, topped with tortilla strips, diced avocado, cheese, cilantro, a dollop of sour cream, and lime wedges.

_Note: For a spicier soup, leave some seeds in the jalapeño or add a dash of hot sauce before serving._
