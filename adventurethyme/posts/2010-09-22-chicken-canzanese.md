_Traditional Italian chicken dish from the Abruzzo region_
_Serves 4_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4 | chicken leg quarters (thigh and drumstick) |
| 2 tsp | kosher salt |
| 1 tsp | freshly ground black pepper |
| 3 Tbsp | olive oil |
| 4 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 4 slices | prosciutto or pancetta, chopped |
| 8 | sage leaves |
| 2 | bay leaves |
| 2 tsp | dried rosemary |
| 1/4 tsp | red pepper flakes |
| 1 cup | dry white wine |
| 2 Tbsp | lemon juice |
| 2 Tbsp | unsalted butter |
| | Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish) |

## Instructions

1. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
3. Place chicken pieces skin-side down in the skillet and cook without moving until skin is crisp and golden brown, about 6-8 minutes.
4. Turn chicken pieces and cook for another 3 minutes on the other side.
5. Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic, prosciutto or pancetta, sage leaves, bay leaves, rosemary, and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring the aromatics but not moving the chicken.
6. Add wine and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer, then cover and reduce heat to low.
7. Simmer gently for about 40-45 minutes, until chicken is very tender and cooked through.
8. Remove chicken to a serving platter and keep warm.
9. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer the sauce until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
10. Remove from heat and stir in butter until melted and incorporated.
11. Pour the sauce over the chicken pieces and garnish with chopped parsley.

_Serving suggestion: Serve with polenta, risotto, or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce._
