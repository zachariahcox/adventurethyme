## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 lb (2 cups) | dried cannellini beans, rinsed and picked over |
| 8 cups | water |
| 1 | onion, peeled and halved |
| 4 cloves | garlic, peeled |

## Instructions

1. Place the rinsed beans in the pressure cooker insert.
2. Add water, onion, garlic, bay leaves, rosemary, and olive oil. Do not add salt at this stage.
3. Secure the lid and set the pressure release valve to "Sealing" position.
4. Select "Pressure Cook" or "Manual" setting and set the cooking time to 40 minutes at high pressure.
5. When the cooking cycle is complete, allow pressure to release naturally for 20 minutes.
6. After 20 minutes, release any remaining pressure manually by turning the valve to "Venting" position.
7. Remove and discard the bay leaves, rosemary sprig, and onion halves.
8. Stir in salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

_Note: These beans can be used in soups, stews, salads, or mashed for dips. The cooking liquid is flavorful and can be used as a base for soups._
