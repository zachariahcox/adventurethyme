_From Mahdur Jaffrey's "From Curries to Kebabs"_

_Serves 6_

**Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
|  | ** |


_For marinating the fish:_

2 lbs skinless salmon fillet, preferably center-cut

1/3 tsp salt

1.3 tsp cayenne pepper

1.3 tsp ground turmeric

  

_For the poaching sauce:_

3 tsp whole brown mustard seeds

1.5 T ground coriander (best if ground fresh)

1 tsp ground cumin

1/4 tsp ground turmeric

1 tsp curry powder (Bolst's Hot Curry Powder is best)

1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

3/4 tsp salt

1 can drained diced tomatoes (or 1 cup fresh diced tomatoes)

2 T olive oil

1 T mustard oil (if possible, more olive oil fine too)

1/2 tsp whole fennel seeds (optional)

15 to 20 fresh curry leaves (these are critical to the dish!)

  

**Directions**

1\. Cut the salmon into manageable serving pieces, about 2x3 inches. Dust both sides with the salt, cayenne pepper, and turmeric and rub into the fish. Place the fish in a plastic bag and refrigerate for 1 to 6 hrs.

  

2\. Grind 2.5 tsp of the mustard seeds in a spice grinder. Put in a bowl. Add the ground coriander, cumin, turmeric, curry powder, cayenne pepper, salt, tomato, and 1/2 cup of water. Mix well and set aside.

  

3\. Pour the two oils into a large pan and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put in the remaining 1/2 tsp of mustard seeds. As soon as they begin to pop, a matter of seconds, add the fennel seeds. Stir once and put in the curry paste, as well as another 1 cup of water and the curry leaves. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 10 minutes. (This sauce can be refrigerated for several hours.)

  

4\. Reheat the sauce in the pan and lay the fish pieces in it in a single layer. Simmer on a low heat until the bottom of the fish pieces appear to be done, about 5 minutes. Carefully turn the fish pieces over and cook for a further 4 to 5 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through.
