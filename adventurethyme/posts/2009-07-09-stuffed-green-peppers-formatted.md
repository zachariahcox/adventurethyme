_Classic comfort food with a savory beef and rice filling_
_Serves 6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6 | large green bell peppers |
| 1 lb | ground beef |
| 1 | medium onion, diced |
| 2 cloves | garlic, minced |
| 1 cup | cooked rice |
| 1 (14.5 oz) can | diced tomatoes, drained (reserve juice) |
| 1 (8 oz) can | tomato sauce |
| 1 tsp | Worcestershire sauce |
| 1 tsp | dried oregano |
| 1 tsp | dried basil |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1/4 tsp | black pepper |
| 1 cup | shredded cheddar cheese, divided |
| | Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish) |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Rinse peppers under cold water.
3. In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the peppers for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.
4. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef and onion until meat is browned and onion is softened, about 5-7 minutes. Drain excess fat.
5. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
6. Stir in cooked rice, drained diced tomatoes, half of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes to blend flavors.
7. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese.
8. In a baking dish, mix the reserved tomato juice with the remaining tomato sauce. Spread in the bottom of the dish.
9. Arrange the blanched peppers, cut side up, in the baking dish.
10. Fill each pepper with the beef and rice mixture.
11. Cover with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes.
12. Remove foil, sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese on top of the peppers, and bake uncovered for an additional 5-10 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.
13. Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

_Note: For a variation, you can substitute ground turkey for the beef, or add other vegetables like corn or black beans to the filling._
