_French upside-down caramelized pear tart_
_Serves 8_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6-7 | firm but ripe pears (Bosc or Anjou work well) |
| 1 | lemon, juiced |
| 3/4 cup | granulated sugar |
| 6 Tbsp | unsalted butter |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract |
| 1/2 tsp | ground cinnamon |
| 1 pinch | salt |
| 1 | sheet puff pastry, thawed if frozen |
| | Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, for serving |

## Instructions

1. Peel, halve, and core the pears. Toss with lemon juice to prevent browning.
2. In a 10-inch cast-iron or oven-safe skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until it dissolves and turns amber, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, cinnamon, and salt.
4. Arrange the pear halves cut-side up in the skillet, fitting them tightly together with the narrow ends pointing toward the center.
5. Return to medium-low heat and cook for 10-15 minutes until the pears begin to soften and absorb the caramel.
6. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
7. Roll out the puff pastry sheet to a circle slightly larger than the skillet. Place the pastry over the pears, tucking the edges down inside the pan.
8. Cut a few small slits in the pastry to allow steam to escape.
9. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and puffed.
10. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
11. Run a knife around the edge of the skillet to loosen the tart. Place a serving plate upside down over the skillet and carefully but quickly flip the tart onto the plate.
12. Replace any pears that may have stuck to the pan.
13. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

_Note: This tart is best served the day it's made, while the pastry is still crisp._
