_Serves 8-10 as a side dish_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 8 cups | cornbread, crumbled (preferably day-old) |
| 1/4 cup | butter |
| 1 | large onion, diced |
| 2 | celery stalks, diced |
| 2 tsp | dried sage |
| 1 tsp | dried thyme |
| 1/2 tsp | dried rosemary |
| 2 cups | chicken or turkey broth |
| 2 | large eggs, beaten |
| 1/2 cup | fresh parsley, chopped |
| | Salt and pepper to taste |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. Place crumbled cornbread in a large bowl.
3. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and celery and sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
4. Add sage, thyme, and rosemary to the skillet and cook for another minute until fragrant.
5. Pour the vegetable mixture over the cornbread crumbs and mix gently.
6. Add broth, beaten eggs, and parsley. Mix gently until everything is well combined and moistened. The mixture should be moist but not soggy. Add more broth if needed.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.
9. Bake for 40-45 minutes until the top is golden brown and the stuffing is set.

_Note: For a variation, add 1 cup of chopped pecans or 1/2 pound of cooked and crumbled sausage to the mixture before baking._
