Here's a comprehensive prompt that would help you standardize recipe formatting from scratch:

# Recipe Standardization Prompt

Please help me standardize the formatting of my recipe collection to ensure a consistent, clean layout across all files. Use the following consistent format for all recipes:

## Structure Requirements

1. **Front Matter**: Preserve the existing YAML front matter with title, date, and original_link.

2. **Recipe Notes**: Format serving info, attribution, or cooking times as italicized notes at the top (`_Note text here_`).

3. **Section Headers**: Use level-2 markdown headings (`## Ingredients`, `## Instructions`) for main sections.

4. **Subsections**: If needed, use level-3 markdown headings (`### For the Sauce:`, etc.) to organize ingredient groups.

5. **Ingredients Table**: Format all ingredients in a proper markdown table:
   ```
   | Quantity | Ingredient |
   | -------- | ---------- |
   | 2 cups | flour |
   | 1 tsp | salt |
   ```
   - Move all quantities to the left column
   - Use "to taste" for seasonings without specific amounts
   - Use "as needed" for garnishes or optional items

6. **Instructions**: Format all steps as a clean numbered list:
   ```
   1. First step here.
   2. Second step here.
   ```
   - Remove any prefixes like "1." or bold formatting from step numbers
   - Each step should be clear and concise

7. **Notes and Tips**: Format recipe notes or tips as italicized text at the end (`_Note: text here_`).

## Example of Properly Formatted Recipe

```markdown
---
title: "Recipe Name"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
original_link: https://original-link.com
---

_Serves 4-6_

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 cup | ingredient one |
| 2 tsp | ingredient two |
| to taste | salt and pepper |

## Instructions

1. First instruction step.
2. Second instruction step.
3. Third instruction step.

Please process all my recipe files in the posts directory to match this consistent format. Preserve all recipe content while improving the formatting.
